# PHP-AUTUMN

## About
This is a SpringBoot knock-off using PHP that I have created during participating Web Programming Course.

## Features
This framework covers some basic web application features which I have used in my course final project:
* Serving Web Content ([guide](https://github.com/ptquang2000/php-autumn/tree/web-controller))
* Accessing MySQL Database ([guide](https://github.com/ptquang2000/php-autumn/tree/db-connection))
* Building Rest Services ([guide](https://github.com/ptquang2000/php-autumn/tree/rest-service))

> Disclaimer</br>
> These guide is taken from Spring Boot Guide with php tranformation.
