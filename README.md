# PHP-AUTUMN

## About
This is a knock-off of SpringBoot that I create during participating Web Programming Course.
Due to this course final project, it is not allowed to use any existed php framework
when making a php web application, so I build one for myself.

## Features
This framework covers some basic features which I use in my course final project:
* Serving Web Content ([guide](https://github.com/ptquang2000/php-autumn/tree/web-controller))
* Acessing MySQL Database ([guide](https://github.com/ptquang2000/php-autumn/tree/db-connection))
* Building Rest Services ([guide](https://github.com/ptquang2000/php-autumn/tree/rest-service))
